Features:
	✔ Display a prompt when waiting for a new command. @done(24-01-30 13:47)
	✔ Have a working history. @done(24-01-30 13:47)
	✔ Search and launch the right executable @done(24-01-30 13:47)
		✔ based on the PATH variable @done(24-01-30 13:46)
		✔ using a relative or an absolute path @done(24-01-30 13:47)
	☐ Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal.
	✔ Not interpret unclosed quotes @done(24-01-30 14:15)
	☐ Not interperet special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
		Should these special characters give an error, or just be treated as normal characters?
	☐ Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
	☐ Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
	✔ Implement redirections @done(24-01-30 13:51)
		✔ < should redirect input @done(24-01-30 13:51)
		✔ > should redirect output @done(24-01-30 13:51)
		✔ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history! @done(24-01-30 13:51)
		✔ >> should redirect output in append mode @done(24-01-30 13:51)
	✔ Implement pipes (| character). @done(24-01-30 13:52)
	☐ Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
		Has to be done before running command, as environment variable may e.g. contain name of command
	☐ Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
		Could be handled right before running command?
	☐ Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should BEHAVE LIKE IN BASH
		✔ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line @done(24-01-30 13:55)
		✔ ctrl-D exits the shell @done(24-01-30 13:55)
		✔ ctrl-\ does nothing @done(24-01-30 13:56)

Built-in functions:
	☐ echo with option -n
	☐ cd with only a relative or absolute path
	☐ pwd with no options
	☐ export with no options
	☐ unset with no options
	☐ env with no options or arguments
	☐ exit with no options

Bonus:
	✔ && and || with parenthesis for priorities. @done(24-01-30 13:59)
	☐ Wildcards * should work for the current working directory.

Fixes:
	☐ Unnecessary "syntax error near unexpected token `(’" in e.g. "awk 'BEGIN { for(i=1;i<=5;i++) print "10 x", i, "is",10*i; }'"
	☐ When giving a piped command: "syntax error near unexpected token `|’" (probably in function check_cmd_line_syntax)
	☐ ctrl-C should not print "^C"
	☐ ctrl-D should print "exit" before exiting

Unsure:
	☐ << should read the input until a line CONTAINING the delimiter is seen, bash reads until a line ONLY CONTAINING

Tester:
	☐ Figure out how to test in interactive mode for e.g. "cd" testing

		was error in pipe check in run command
	✔ "./false 1 && ./true 2 || ./true 3" stopping after first false @done(24-01-30 15:40)
		was error in my fix to an error when compiling with mac
	✔ "./true 1 && ./false 2 || (./true 3 && ./false 4) || ./false 5 && ./true 6" skipping parentheses @done(24-02-01 10:20)
		was error in how I had combined the shell and run command sections
